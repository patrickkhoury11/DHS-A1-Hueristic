# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
## Tentative Title: Social Media for Sustainable Development
### Topic of Interest: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Patrick Khoury | DH110 | Fall 2022

### About the project

According to the United Nations, cities occupy just 3 percent of the Earth’s land, but account for 60-80 percent of energy consumption and 75 percent of carbon emissions. Inequality and the levels of urban energy consumption emissions are sprawling all suburbs all over the world.This has become such an issue that 9 in 10 people living in urban areas worldwide were breathing air that did not meet the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines. By choosing to act sustainably, we choose to build cities where all citizens live a decent quality of life, and form a part of the city’s productive dynamic, creating shared prosperity and social stability without harming the environment. The cost of implementing sustainable practices in place is minimal in comparison with the benefits. For example, there is a cost to creating a functional public transport network, but the benefits are huge in terms of economic activity, quality of life, the environment, and the overall success of a networked city. All these issues facing sustainability will eventually affect every citizen. Inequality can lead to unrest and insecurity, pollution deteriorates everyone’s health and affects workers’ productivity and therefore the economy, and natural disasters have the potential to disrupt everyone’s lifestyles. In my project, I hope to present a social-media-type app concept which incentivizes target users to be environmentally conscious, promotes activities and sustainable brands, allows for information to be presented to users, connects people who are existing or potential friends, and so much more. In the following assignment, I will evaluate the heuristics of two websites, one pertaining to my project subject and one not, based on Jakob Nielson’s 10 general principles for interaction design.

### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) Explained

| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Users should always be informed about what is going on and should be given appropriate feedback to their actions |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Use concepts and language that are familiar and logical to the user |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Allow users to make mistakes; give them options to undo and redo tasks |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | Follow conventions and make sure design is consistent across the platform |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Get rid of error-prone conditions and provide users with safety nets for high-cost errors |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Minimize user's memory load by giving them suggestions and help in context |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Provide multiple ways to perform a task to make the platform accessible to all users |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Provide only relevant content and features |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | Tell users what the problem is and provide suggestions to fix it |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Supply users with extra help to complete their tasks |


### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group

The following rating scale, based upon Nielson's own scale, can be used to evaluate the severity of usability issues:

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |
| 4 | Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released |

Ratings are displayed in parentheses after each usability issue. 

### Reasons for Utilization of Severity Ratings: 
| Number | Reason | 
|---|---|
| 1 | Used to allocate the most resources to fix the most serious problems. |
| 2 | Can provide a rough estimate of the need for additional usability efforts. |

### About
[The Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/) is a department run by the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization made up of 193 member states committed to maintaining peace, dignity, and equality on a healthy planet. Based on a global survey, conducted by international research agency Glocalities, indicates that the United Nations is trusted significantly more by the world population than any other international or governmental organization. 

In this sector, the United Nations defines 17 Sustainable Department Goals (SDG) for all. The purpose of this website is to help inspire and mobilize actions promoting the implementation of SDGs around the world. Using the latest data and estimates, the annual SDG report provides an overview of the world’s implementation efforts to date. 


### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* As you type in the search bar, the given suggestions are extremely flawed, displaying random letters, numbers, and symbols which mean nothing and lead to nowhere. Upon clicking on one of these suggestions, the site fed back a message stating that they were too long for the search bar character limit. After finding one within the character limit, I got a message stating that there were no matching results. These autocomplete recommendations are constant for every letter in the alphabet. (3)

> *Recommendation: Vet the system for all random letters, numbers, and symbols in the search bar. Cleaning this up will allow users to make relevant searches and find topics of interest more easily.*

* Furthermore, the recommended results shown are mostly completely unrelated to sustainable development, which doesn't help the user navigate the website or effectively find information about the topic. (2)

> *Recommendation: Optimize search results so that they are relevant to sustainable development only.*

* Lastly, the search bar does not feed out suggestions in real time. Instead, a loading icon pops up after you are done typing, and it takes time to offer any autocomplete results. This could be particularly troublesome to users who may not know the exact term they want to look up, or to those who have accidentally misspelled a word. (2)

> *Recommendation: Display results as the user types. This allows the user to find the information they were looking for much easier and helps them stay engaged.*


#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* The site lists the related Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) for each article and event as numbers, with no text displaying what the numbers are referring to. The goals the numbers represent are not known to the vast majority of viewers. To be able to view the meaning behind each number, the user would have to scroll down to the very bottom of the website to see the info. (2)

> *Recommendation: Write out the actual SDG for each article and event rather than displaying it as a number. This will enhance viewer comprehension, as it is impossible to expect new viewers to understand what each number represents.*

* Additionally, the navigation bar uses acronyms that first-time visitors might be unfamiliar with. For example, the terms “HLPF” and “SIDS” are items featured on the navigation menu, but do not provide any insight on what those letters stand for. (2)

> *Recommendation: As stated by Jakob Nielson himself, “use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon.”*


#### 3. User Control and Freedom
* There are no “return to last page” buttons throughout the website. To be able to backtrack to the last page, the viewer would have to hit the search engine’s “click to go back” arrow. However this feature does not always work exactly at its intended use in this website. Some sub-pages aren’t registered as distinct pages according to the search engine, and the click to go back arrow skips pages at times. The mechanic on this site is rather faulty and can be frustrating to viewers attempting to go back and forth between pages. (2)

> *Recommendation: Add a "review to last page button" or register sub-pages as distinct pages with differing URLs so the "click to go back" arrow on the top left of the search engine allows you to view the previous page.*


#### 4. Consistency and Standards
* Most sections on this website follow completely different formats. This makes it difficult for users to navigate through the pages to find relevant information, as the design is inconsistent across all pages and subpages. (2)

> *Recommendation: Maintain some form of consistency within each page in the main website, so that users are able to navigate throughout the website without any issue.*

* The HLPF page features a completely different menu than the majority of the website, with different navigation options. This does not allow you to go back to any of the primary sections of the website. This issue is particularly frustrating, as the HLPF page is featured as a key proponent of the Sustainable Development website, but has no option to navigate to any of the other pages within the site. (2)

> *Recommendation: Maintain consistency within all branches of the main website so that users are able to navigate understand they are still in the same space. Keep the same navigation options for all pages within the main website, so users can navigate freely without any issues.*

* The logo on the top-left corner on several pages does not take you to the homepage by clicking it. Instead, it takes you to a language prompt which directs you to the standard UN page. To get back to the Sustainable Development section, you’d have to navigate through the “Our Work” section on the navigation bar. This can be frustrating to those who intend to reach the homepage by clicking the logo in the top left. This isn’t an unreasonable action of the user, as many of the pages function in this correct way. (2)

> *Recommendation: Make sure that clicking the logo will go back to the Sustainable Development homepage on every page within the website. Maintain consistency with functionalities so users don't get 'lost' on a certain page and are always able to return to the homepage.*


#### 5. Error Prevention
* As mentioned above, the possible recommendations in the search bar are extremely flawed, displaying random letters, numbers, and symbols which mean nothing and lead to nowhere. This is an error-prone condition, as the two outcomes from clicking on one of these flawed suggestions are not being within the character limit or getting an error message saying no matching results. (3)

> *Recommendation: Get rid of all uncomprehensible suggestions in the search bar. This turned the search bar, a tool utilized to mitigate errors and naviagte the website, into an error-prone feature. Fixing its issues will solve this error prevention issue.*


#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
* The suggestions given in the search bar are not relevant to the website whatsoever. The majority of key terms, goals, etc that are relevant to the website do not come up as suggestions in the search bar. This makes it difficult for users who may not know or remember the name of an event, goal, etc to access information about it since they have to enter it verbatim. (2)

> *Recommendation: Provide actual assistence within the search bar. Suggestions have the opportunity to guide users to particular items in the website that they are looking for. This new system would allow users to research and recognize topics they would like to learn more about, rather than being forced to recall the exact name and spelling to be able to utiize the search bar.*


#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
* The accessibility of the navigation bar can be a pain point to some viewers. It is relatively small and overshadowed by the large photos and graphics. Users must scroll all the way to the top to utilize it, as the website doesn’t make use of the “floating” feature typically incorporated in most websites. Additionally, this website doesn’t feature  a “scroll to top” button, which makes accessing the bar even more difficult. (1)

> *Recommendation: Implement a "floating" navigation bar and a "scroll to top button" to reduce the scrolling required on the site, making the platform more accessible to all users.*

* Another pain point on the site is the lack of organization for the news feed. The “NEWS” tab leads users to a page with 8 articles, the top 2 of which have misaligned thumbnails. While there appear to be more pages of news/articles, the site requires you to step through the pages one by one using arrows. However, the site neither shows how many pages there are in total, nor does it allow you to easily jump between pages. If a user was on page 10 of the News feed and wanted to go back to the first page, they would have to click the back arrow 9 times. (2)

> *Recommendation: Implement a navigation bar on the bottom of the News tab page, allowing viewers to flip through any and all existing articles without having to click the back or forward arrow more than once.*


#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
* This website features additional graphics and information not relevant to the general topic. Examples of this include the home page, event pages, the news tab, etc. Although aesthetically pleasing in some instances, many of the graphics take attention away from the pertinent information and are a bit overwhelming for someone simply trying to get relevant info (1)

> *Recommendation: Cut down on the unnecessary images and draw focus to the relevant information. The page is run for the purpose of promoting sustainable development, but does not do a good job of drawing the readers to the important info.*


#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
* I clicked through the entire website and couldn't find any unnecessary or unclear error messages. This website did not featrure many errors, the only error inducing condition I found was the faulty search bar recommendations. However, even with this error the website wrote out what was wrong in clear sentences and allowed users to recover very easily after committing the error. (0)


#### 10. Help and Documentation
* This website doesn’t feature a help page or FAQ, only a search bar. I believe a help page or FAQ section would be extremely beneficial to all who view the website. Furthermore, the added features would help mitigate other issues, such as the search bar, as most of the information on this site is not easily accessible to a first time viewer. (3)

> *Recommendation: Include both a HELP page and FAQ section in this website. The website is meant to educate the population, and yet it does not feature any sections to mitigate the confusion their viewers are subject to. This is a missed opportunity to clarify important details and answer common questions.*

### Overall Assessment

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) Sustainable Development website was not terrible by any means. However, the high standards I upheld for the intergovernmental organization were not met. There were several visibility of system status issues, mainly to do with the search bar. The website used unfamiliar wording and acronyms, and the site suffered from its many usability issues. Some of these issues include a faulty homepage logo, poor naviagation bar choices, no effective back button, etc. Perhaps the most pressing issue is the search bar suggestions. This issue is error inducing and quite frustrating. Not only does it recommend random combinations of numbers, symbols, and letters; but it also does not suggest anything remotely relevant to the topic of the website. Some of these issues could have been mitigated if the creators had implemented a HELP page of FAQ section, however this was not the case. 



## Website 2: [Yale University Art School](https://www.art.yale.edu/)

View the full site here: [Yale Art](https://www.art.yale.edu/)


### About
Yale University is a private Ivy League Research institution and one of the most distinguished universities in the world. It has upheld this excellence since its establishment in 1701. Contrary to popular belief, Yale is actually best known for their excellent drama, music, and art programs. According to [usnews.com](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/yale-university-1426#:~:text=Yale%20University%2C%20located%20in%20New,and%20the%20Yale%20Dramatic%20Association), Yale ranks 2nd in Best Fine Arts Programs (tie), 2nd in Graphic Design, 1st in Painting / Drawing, 2nd in Sculpture (tie), and 1st in Photography in the United States. 

The [Yale School of Art website](https://www.art.yale.edu/) is the official website of the university’s graduate art program..It functions as a wiki; all school of art grad students, faculty, staff, and alums have the ability to change most of this site’s content (with some exceptions); and to add new content and pages. This can be particularly problematic. My goal is to make their website much more usable and accessible for all who view the site.

### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* Yale’s School of Art website unfortunately displays inconsistent feedback indicators for user action, perhaps as a symptom of its mish-mash of creators. On the site, the user hovering their cursor over certain links results in a feedback indicator of some kind; however, not only are the indicators inconsistent with one another, some links lack feedback indicators altogether. For example, in some cases, clickable links turn blue when the user navigates their cursor over them; in other cases, hovering the cursor over calendar events highlights and shakes the event. In both of these instances, the feedback provided leads the user to believe that clinking on the link or even would lead to a subpage on the site or to a different site altogether. In addition, some links are denoted with two arrows “>>” and some are denoted with just one “>”. Certainly, there is room for improvement in standardizing the feedback so as to ensure the user is clear about what the indicators mean. The potential user confusion due to inconsistency is only further compounded by the fact that not all links on the site have appropriate feedback for user action. Some links do not highlight or turn blue when the user hovers their cursor over it, potentially leading to issues with users not knowing that interacting with that link would potentially lead them to a subpage or different site -- they don’t appear to be “clickable” links. (3)

> *Recommendation: Ensure that feedback indicators are standardized across the site: all links should turn blue when the user hovers over them and be denoted by the double-arrow “>>” in order to create predictable interactions and build up user trust in the product.*

#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
*  The home page and many others use acronyms that first-time visitors might be unfamiliar with. For example, the acronym “SOA” is featured largely on the menu, but does not provide any insight on what those letters stand for. (2)

*Recommendation: “Replace the “SOA” acronym with the spelled out School of Art name, as many first-time site visitors would not remember what the acronym stands for. School of Art is not too long to spell out; furthermore, it is central to understanding the website, and as such, it is important to not assume that users are familiar with the acronym.*

#### 3. User Control and Freedom
* Does not promote user control and freedom to back out of processes -- for example, when selecting “Editor Details” within the Community Bulletin Board space, the “Editor Details” box enlarges and changes to reflect the respective editors’ names and note who has editor access. However, there is no clear way to exit that change: no cancel, undo, or “X” button to return to the original formatting. This is especially problematic when the enlarged size of the box containing the editors’ names covers up information that was previously readable. One can exit this interaction by clicking outside of the box, but this revert function is not clearly labeled and discoverable. (3)

> *Recommendation: Make sure that the revert function is clearly labeled within the enlarged “Editor Details” box via an “X” cancel button in order to increase user control and freedom.*

#### 4. Consistency and Standards
* There is no proper organization of the elements on the website. They are clustered together with no order of hierarchy or importance. (3)

* The inconsistent use of colors, fade effects, borders, and font styles (uppercase, lowercase, italicized, bold, underlined, and regular font) is distracting to say the very least. It makes the website practically unusable. (3)

> *Recommendation: Although the mis-matched nature of the website is to be expected due to the collaborative design effort, it is still important to ensure that the design does not take away from the user experience. In order to remedy this lack of organization while still keeping with the original theme / character of the website, a potential recommendation would be to take on a more traditional approach, but feature students art and achievements on the site. This would concur with the heuristic principles layed out by Jakob Nielson while maintaining the character and theme of art and creativity.*

* Inconsistent acronym usage “SoA in the world Calendar” in one place and right below it is “School of Arts in the world Calendar.” (2)

> *Recommendation: Keep verbiage consistent throughout the website to avoid confusing users.*

#### 5. Error Prevention
* Website crashed often when I was navigating through it. The message it gave off was, "The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request. Please contact the server administrator, johannes.deyoung@yale.edu and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error. More information about this error may be available in the server error log." The frequency of this error is quite concerning. It damages the credibility of the website and prevents users from accessing any parts. (3)

> *Recommendation: Troubleshoot the internal error and find the cause of this mishap. I wouldn't be surprised if it had something to do with the unfathomable amount of graphics and animations, as they tend to make the website more glitchy.*

#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
* I clicked through the entire website and couldn't find any instances where additional suggestions would minimize a user's memory load by giving them help in context. This website was very thorough, which I imagine is due to the sheer amount of people who worked on the site and the perspectives they bring. Although the design of the website made the suggestions hard to read, they were present and very helpful in navigating and gathering information from the website. (0)

#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
* The navigation bar is hidden as a first-time user on the page may not easily locate it for easy navigation through the various sections of the website. (2)

> *Recommendation: Implement a search function to allow users another option to efficiently navigate through the website.*

* The user experience of the community bulletin board was far too complex for the creators to expect users to contribute to. (2)

> *Recommendation: The community board should be well simplified so it does not overwhelm the user and can also carry the same experience as a real board.*

#### 8. Aesthetics and Minimalist Design
* Throughout the website, viewers are forced to browse on an unappealing interface due to incorrect placement of features, inconsistent fonts, colors, and other design aspects. There are a myriad of low-quality images, cluttered and conflicting elements, and web developer mistakes. Altogether, the website is confusing for any user and lowers the credibility of the organization. This is apparent in every page on the website. This is concerning considering some of the pages present cruicial information and deadlines which shouldn't be missed. Two of these pages include the Community Health Center homepage and the student finance/tuition/financial aid pages. (3)

* The homepage of the website is particularly bad. It bombards users with crazy colors, graphics, unreadable text, and too many options. It is a nightmare for first time viewers, incoming and returning students, parents, teachers, alumni, etc. The design and colors of the website creates accessibility issues for people who potentially want to apply to the school but may have visual impairments. The design exudes unprofessionalism, which is shocking coming from a world-renowed institution. (3)

> *Recommendation: Make a fun, artsy, but professional looking website which doesn't take away from the user-experience. This website features extremely important information which has become unusable to people who want/need to acess it.*

#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
* When attempting to sign in as a visitor on the site, it prompts you to select whether or not you have a Yale NetID. After entering your information, it places you back to the page asking if you have a Yale NetID account. Furthermore, if you type the wrong account information into the sign in page, there is no indication of whether the username or password was incorrect (or both). It simply takes you back to the previous page without signing you in. (2)

> *Recommendation: Fix the site error that takes the user back to the Yale NetID account prompt page, despite attempting to sign in as a visitor. This loopback does not allow users to understand what went wrong -- do they have to have a Yale NetID to log in even as a visitor, or is there just a technical site issue? Also, add an error message to the sign in page when wrong username and/or password information is inputted to indicate what went wrong, and offer a solution to fix this, such as linking to a password reset page.*

#### 10. Help and Documentation
* This website doesn’t feature a help page, FAQ, search bar, or any feature that provides additional help to the user. I believe all these features would be extremely beneficial to all who view the website. Furthermore, these added features would help mitigate other issues, such as searching for information in the atrociously organized and designed website. Most of the information on this site is not easily accessible to a first time viewer. (3)

> *Recommendation: Include a HELP page, FAQ section, and a search bar in this website. The website is meant to be accessed by those wishing to attend / already do attend one of the most presigous institutions in the nation. These features will help mitigate the other obvious shortcomings in the design of the website. In this instance, these features are absolutely necessary.*

### Overall Assessment

The Yale School of Art website purports to be an “ongoing collaborative experiment in digital publishing and information sharing” by existing as a wiki-esque site that can be edited by any member of the community. Though this experiment is certainly impressive and makes a bold statement to users that come across the site, the mis-matched nature of the website ultimately detracts from its usability in a variety of ways. Key issues within Visibility of System Status, Consistency and Standards, and Aesthetic and Minimalist Design usability heuristics for user interface design all point to issues with the site being too busy and disorganized. The site pages lack clear navigation and information grouping that makes it difficult to have a clear, consistent user experience. Instead, coupled with error message issues, the site becomes difficult and frustrating to use to access information. The Yale School of Art should focus key improvements to centralize on a core design and more organized information, simplifying the site to ensure that users are able to more easily navigate it without being overwhelmed or distracted.


## Website 2: [Global Platform for Sustainable Cities](https://www.thegpsc.org/)

![biodiversity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114698093/196871540-cdc785ab-64e1-4c0a-99a0-e469167fff86.png)
View the full site here: [Global Platform for Sustainable Cities]((https://www.thegpsc.org/))


### About
The Global Platform for Sustainable Cities (GPSC) is a partnership and knowledge platform that promotes integrated solutions and cutting-edge support for cities seeking to improve their urban sustainability. They are funded by the Global Environment Facility and have partnered with approximately 30 cities and a myriad of knowledge partners. Their goal is to develop solutions for sustainable urban growth. The platform’s initiative involves cross-cutting activities such as knowledge creation, capacity development, city networking, integrated urban planning/management, municipal finance, and sustainability indicators.

### Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* This site largely is able to be navigated and understood by any layperson user without technical knowledge of the sustainability jargon that so often inundates similar websites. The one issue I found while evaluating for this particular heuristic has to do with how the site displays their funding partners: on the GPSC Core Funding Partner page, all funding partners are displayed by images of their logos. Many of these logos do not feature text or acronyms the common user would be familiar with, as they are not clearly defined. Unfortunately, the site seems to treat interpreting the logos of these companies as common knowledge, despite the fact that users are most likely to be completely unfamiliar with them -- I have a keen interest in sustainability myself and was unable to recognize the vast majority of logos on this page. Although the site itself is obviously familiar with these organizations, there is no mechanism the user can take to identify the names of funders at a glance if they do not know all of the logos. (1)

> *Recommendation: In order to better match to the real world and accommodate for a larger audience’s general knowledge, the site should add small labels next to the funder logos so that the user is able to identify the organizations’ names.*

> *Recommendation: In order to better match to the real world and accommodate for a larger audience’s general knowledge, the site should add small labels next to the funder logos so that the user is able to identify the organizations’ names.*



#### 3. User Control and Freedom
As I searched through the entire website, I could not find any instances where the design imposed an action on the viewer or made any decisions for them. On many of the subpages, where more than one click was necessary, this website featured orange “Return to Main C4B Website” buttons visible on the very top of the page to allow users to return back to the home page after navigating through the site. I have found that the user is always able to backtrack to the last page and navigate freely throughout the entire website, allowing for total user control and freedom without any further recommendations. (0)

#### 4. Consistency and Standards
* This website struggles with consistency and standards -- both with internal and external consistency. For internal consistency concerns, the main issue that I encountered was that the layout of each page is completely different, which makes the website difficult to navigate at times. For example, the About page follows a format of text followed by image, the C4B page exclusively features pictures as links to subpages, and the City Dashboard page is overtaken by a large, interactive map. Although the different elements could be useful to the user for the different pages’ respective goals, the lack of internal consistency as to formatting does not allow the site to feel cohesive. This is an issue where the user does not know what to expect on the pages -- I found myself clicking through multiple pages to find one subsection I wanted to read because the text happened to be placed on the bottom of that particular page, and I was looking for it at the top of the page because that’s where similar information was on other pages. In addition, the site exhibits issues with external consistency, particularly within the events page. Ultimately, the events page could use an entire rework as it is nearly impossible to search for any specific event effectively. The search bar is hidden and features the same issues that limit the effectiveness of the home page search bar (discussed in Heuristic #1.) The main issue in terms of external consistency is that on this site, users can only filter the results by type of events: GPSC Events, Partner Events, Resource Team Events, and Global Meeting. This does not narrow the selection down nearly enough, as the user has to end up scanning sections for specific events with 60-80 existing results. There is no way for the user to filter by city, subject, or any kind of term which may plausibly be relevant to them -- and is the norm for events pages on a number of other sites. Users have gotten so used to being able to filter down to their exact needs that being presented with 60-80 options as the most narrowed down the search can go is immediately frustrating, and prompts a comparison to other sites that can filter down events further. (2)


> *Recommendation: Remedy internal consistency concerns by implementing a consistent page and button layout to ensure that the site is more easily navigated. This would work to lower the learning curve and users would not have to go looking for certain information because the placement of content fields is different on each page. In addition, remedy external consistency concerns by reworking the events page to 1) have a more effective search bar in line with recommendations from Heuristic #1, and 2) filter down events more effectively by implementing additional location and date filters at the very least. In implementing these recommendations, the site would fare much better in terms of external consistency, as users will no longer be unhappy with how the events page functions in comparison to other sites they are used to being more convenient.*


#### 5. Error Prevention
* This website does not always have sufficient error prevention mechanisms in place. For example, there is a bar to enter your email and sign up for the site’s newsletter on the header and footer of the website. In attempting to sign up for the newsletter to test this function on the site, I noticed that I accidentally inputted my email incorrectly but was not met with any error messages. I decided to test this again, this time with an email address that was just a bunch of random letters and an “@” sign at the end, and again, this email went through with no issues. Instead, the site noted via pop-up message that “You will receive a confirmation e-mail shortly containing further instructions on how to complete your subscription.” This is problematic, as there is no constraint to valid email addresses when signing up for their newsletter. Because the site does not recognize incomplete email addresses, it is vulnerable to allowing “slips” characterized by Jakob’s Usability Heuristic #5 and leaving the user frustrated when they don’t receive any subscription confirmation emails because the site did not stop them from inputting an invalid address. (3)


> *Recommendation: Implement a constraint to valid email addresses on the site to ensure that all emails submitted for newsletter subscriptions are actually receiving the confirmation emails. (Solution also in combination with actions delineated under Heuristic #9.)*


#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
As I searched through the entire website, I could not find any instances where the user should not have to remember information from one part of the site to another. Information required to use the design was visible when needed. This website was very thorough, which I imagine is due to the sheer amount of people who worked on the site and the diverse perspectives they bring from up to 30 partner cities. Although the design of the website sometimes made the suggestions hard to read (see Heuristic #8, for example), they were present and otherwise helpful in navigating and gathering information from the website.

#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
* This website often employs two mechanisms of communicating information to its users: written information and visual diagrams. Ideally, the alternate versions of information would demonstrate an attempt to accommodate for users with different proficiencies and provide a choice for the method that works best for their needs, in line with Jakob’s Usability Heuristic #7. Unfortunately, a key shortcoming of the site is that visual diagrams are embedded with no way to zoom in on the information. For example, the site’s About page includes a summary of the different initiatives, expressed more succinctly through three main pillars in support of urban sustainability. The pillars are then illustrated via a visual diagram displayed just below the summary, with paragraphs of more in-depth initiative explanations following. The visual diagram of the pillars would have been a great alternative to summarize the longer paragraphs for visitors of the site that perhaps are already aware of these initiatives or are simply looking for a more high-level review. Unfortunately, the site does not have the option to expand or zoom in on the diagram. Seeing as the text within the diagram is of a markedly smaller font than the rest of the text on the site, this reduces the positive impact the diagram would have on flexibility and ease of use. Instead, this frustrates the user when they are unable to make the diagram big enough to read properly. This is also the case with the City Benchmarking visual diagram on the City Dashboard page.

> *Recommendation: In order to promote better flexibility of use, ensure that all diagrams on the site include a zoom or expand function that allows the user to easily access the information displayed.*

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
* Although this site has an aesthetically pleasing and consistent design, there are issues with the design limiting the utility of information in some areas that are especially important to the user. Namely, all of the headers across the different site pages, as well as the titles internally in the Knowledge Resources section are hard to read, as the white text blends in with the white fading effect at the bottom of each heading image. These headings are “necessary elements” in line with those that should be prioritized according to the user heuristic, as they communicate important information for how to navigate what is on the page below. The design choice of the white font in combination with the header image limits the utility of the headers themselves -- and although in most cases, consistency of design across multiple pages is useful for the user, in this case the issue is only magnified by the fact that the font / image combination is used on every page. (3)


> *Recommendation: * In order to ensure that necessary elements are easily viewed and understood by the user, amend the header images to have no fading at the bottom and be dark enough to where the white font is legible, or amend the font itself to a darker color that would stand out on the lighter header image. Ensure that each of the headers are legible in a manner that is consistent across the site..*


#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
* This website does not always help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. As previously mentioned, there is no constraint to valid email addresses when signing up for the newsletter on the site, which is displayed on every single page and subpage. Because the site does not filter out these errors, users are prone to inputting invalid email addresses and feeling frustrated when they do not receive an email confirmation about their newsletter subscription. In addition to the lack of invalid email error messages, the current system is set up to communicate out “You will receive a confirmation e-mail shortly containing further instructions on how to complete your subscription.” when an email is inputted. This is also problematic, as it does not help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from any errors in their data entry. For example, the first time I went to sign up for the site’s newsletter, I inputted an email address and realized after hitting send that I made a mistake. I only picked up on my mistake specifically because I am conducting this heuristic evaluation of the site -- if I was just a regular user, I probably would not have noticed my data entry error. As such, it is an issue that the site only gives the pop up message that “you will receive a confirmation email” without confirming what the email address is itself. Having a message instead state “you will receive a confirmation email at sample.email@google.com containing further instructions …” would help the users recognize, diagnose, and recover from their errors. (3)

> *Recommendation: With regards to the newsletter subscription, ensure that error messages are in place for any invalid emails and incorporate the user email in the pop up message confirming subscription. The error message would allow users to resubmit a valid email, and the pop up message would allow for a mechanism that users can confirm they inputted their email correctly and know they will receive further messaging at the intended address. (Solution also in combination with actions delineated under Heuristic #5.)*


#### 10. Help and Documentation
* This website doesn’t feature a help page or FAQ, only a search bar. I believe a help page or FAQ section would be extremely beneficial to all who view the website. Furthermore, the added features would help mitigate other issues, such as the search bar, as most of the information on this site is not easily accessible to a first time viewer. (3)

> *Recommendation: Include both a HELP page and FAQ section in this website. The website is meant to educate the population, and yet it does not feature any sections to mitigate the confusion their viewers are subject to. This is a missed opportunity to clarify important details and answer common questions.*

### Overall Assessment

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) Sustainable Development website was not terrible by any means. However, the high standards I upheld for the intergovernmental organization were not met. There were several visibility of system status issues, mainly to do with the search bar. The website used unfamiliar wording and acronyms, and the site suffered from its many usability issues. Some of these issues include a faulty homepage logo, poor naviagation bar choices, no effective back button, etc. Perhaps the most pressing issue is the search bar suggestions. This issue is error inducing and quite frustrating. Not only does it recommend random combinations of numbers, symbols, and letters; but it also does not suggest anything remotely relevant to the topic of the website. Some of these issues could have been mitigated if the creators had implemented a HELP page of FAQ section, however this was not the case.
